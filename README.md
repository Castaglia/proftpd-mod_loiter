proftpd-mod_loiter
==================

The `mod_loiter` module for ProFTPD is disconnecting "loitering" connections,
_i.e._ connections which have *not* authenticated quickly, and are simply
doing nothing, taking up available connections.

See the [mod_loiter.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Castaglia/proftpd-mod_loiter/blob/master/mod_loiter.html) documentation for more details.
